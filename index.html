    <div><h4>Domino's Pizza: Delivering Happiness</h4></div>
    <p>
      What’s better than having a crispy melty pizza, you ask? Having that
      crispy and melty pizza in the comfort of your own home with the ones you
      love, we say. With Domino's it is always “Rishton ka time”. Whether it's a
      treat for your promotion, a kid topping his class or winning the heart of
      your wife who is too tired to cook after a long day at work! A cheesy
      slice of the best pizza is all one needs to put things into perspective
      and start any celebration. Plus, you do not even need to rush to the
      restaurant to have one now. A call, a few clicks on our website or a few
      touches on the mobile screen is all you have to do to have that tempting,
      light-on-the-pocket pizza at your doorstep. There is something for
      everyone here. The vegetarians, non-vegetarians, the sides’ lovers and
      also the ones who love to have something sweet by the time they reach the
      last bite of the last slice of pizza slice.
    </p>

    <div><h4>What We Need - More Choice. More Fun.</h4></div>
    <p>
      No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that
      gives you the freedom to choose your toppings - from paneer, crisp
      capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives, fresh
      tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg
      toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken, grilled
      chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost
      endless, anything and everything you can think of that too on top of the
      crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust, cheese
      burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just
      like a pizza, Domino's understands you. And to shoo away those
      end-of-the-month blues while placing your order with our pizza restaurant,
      check out the everyday pizzas from pizza mania combos with everyday value
      offer of 2 pizzas starting at just ₹99 (regular size) and ₹199 (medium
      size) each.
    </p>

    <div><h4>The Promise Of 30-Minute Delivery</h4></div>
    <p>
      The icing on the cake or more aptly the extra cheese on your already
      fabulous pizza is that Domino’s takes only half an hour for its pizza
      delivery service. Don’t believe us? Time it if you please. With 1250+
      stores present all over India, you can have a Domino’s pizza even while
      traveling on a train. Yes, you are reading it right, you can enjoy pizza
      on train too. So stop googling for the “pizza shops near me” and order
      from your nearest pizza outlet to have a hot box of pizza on your table in
      the next 30 minutes, or berth at the next halting station.
